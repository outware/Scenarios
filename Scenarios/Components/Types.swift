///
/// e.g.
///
/// - __Given__ the user is on the Home Screen
/// - __And__ the currently logged-in account is a Type A account
/// - ...
///
/// This scenario performs steps to take the user to the home screen and manipulates
/// setup information such that their logged-in account is a "Type A" account.
///
/// At this stage, the scenario is `Prepared` to:
/// - have some state on the screen (such as the title of the screen) be asserted.
/// - be manipulated / acted upon (for example, by tapping on a button, or scrolling down
///     a list), in preparation for future state assertion.
